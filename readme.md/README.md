A README.md file is the first point of reference for anyone using or contributing to a project. It provides essential information such as the projectâ€™s purpose, how to install and use it, and how to contribute. Written in Markdown format, it helps make your project more understandable and accessible by including clear headings, code snippets, links, and more. A well-written README improves collaboration, encourages contributions, and communicates the value of the project.
